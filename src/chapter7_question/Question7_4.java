		Perform the following tasks for an array called table:
			a) Declare and create the array as an integer array that has three rows and three columns.
			Assume that the constant ARRAY_SIZE has been declared to be 3.
			ANS: int[][] table = new int[ ARRAY_SIZE ][ ARRAY_SIZE ];
			b) How many elements does the array contain?
			ANS: Nine.
			c) Use a for statement to initialize each element of the array to the sum of its indices. Assume that the integer variables x and y are declared as control variables.
			ANS: for ( int x = 0; x < table.length; x++ )
			 for ( int y = 0; y < table[ x ].length; y++ )
			 table[ x ][ y ] = x + y;
