		Find and correct the error in each of the following program segments:
  		a) final int ARRAY_SIZE = 5;
		ARRAY_SIZE = 10;
		ANS: Error: Assigning a value to a constant after it has been initialized.
		Correction: Assign the correct value to the constant in a final int ARRAY_SIZE
		declaration or declare another variable.
		b) Assume int[] b = new int[ 10 ];
		for ( int i = 0; i <= b.length; i++ )
 		b[ i ] = 1;
		ANS: Error: Referencing an array element outside the bounds of the array (b[10]).
		Correction: Change the <= operator to <.
		c) Assume int[][] a = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } };
 		a[ 1, 1 ] = 5;
		ANS: Error: Array indexing is performed incorrectly.
		Correction: Change the statement to a[ 1 ][ 1 ] = 5;.*/
