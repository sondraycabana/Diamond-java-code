	/*	Determine whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
		a) To refer to a particular location or element within an array, we specify the name of the
		array and the value of the particular element.
		ANS: False. The name of the array and the index are specified.
		b) An array declaration reserves space for the array.
		ANS: False. Arrays must be dynamically allocated with new in Java.
		c) To indicate that 100 locations should be reserved for integer array p, the programmer
		writes the declaration
		 p[ 100 ];
		ANS: False. The correct declaration is int p[] = new int[ 100 ];
		d) An application that initializes the elements of a 15-element array to zero must contain
		at least one for statement.
		ANS: False. Numeric arrays are automatically initialized to zero. Also, a member initializer
		list can be used.
		e) An application that totals the elements of a two-dimensional array must contain nested
		for statements.
		ANS: False. It is possible to total the elements of a two-dimensional array with nested while
		statements, nested do…while statements or even individual totaling statements
